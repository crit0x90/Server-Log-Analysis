\section*{Introduction}

New computer systems are created and used daily that affect businesses and 
institutions both large and small. As the prevalence of enterprise computer 
systems grows, so too does the profitability of attacking such systems. With
the quickly changing culture of software development security holes can easily be
introduced as new APIs and frameworks become available but these security risks
can go months or years without being patched. This means that often times it is not
a question of if a user account will be compromised but when a user will be compromised
When a user of one of these systems is compromised a myriad different 
types of information is at risk of being stolen by attackers. Libraries 
risk losing their databases of research papers, businesses risk databases
of customer information, and governments risk their national security.

The purpose of this project was to combat such attackers by attempting to identify
compromised users and alert relevant information security personel before damage 
can be done. This was achieved through analyzing the log files of a server in real
time in order to identify and respond to any users that exhibit suspicious behavior.
The initial motivation for this project came from a university library that was having
trouble with compromised user accounts that would download as many academic papers and 
journals as possible for resale. This would result in the affected databases being locked 
to the entire university until administrators were able to prove to the database provider 
that the attacker had been dealt with.

\section*{Libraries and Resources}
[talk about libraries used and other 
programs that were examined to inspire 
this one, linux features]

\section*{Data Structures}
[talk about data structures used, make diagrams]

\section*{Algorithms}
[talk about algorithms used]

\section*{Paradigms}
[talk about online processing as a paradigm
and why this was a necessary approach to the 
problem]

or was it batch processing?


\section*{Future Work}
[talk about future work that could be done for
this project and projects that could take inspiration
from this one]
